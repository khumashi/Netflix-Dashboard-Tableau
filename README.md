# 📊 Netflix Dashboard – Tableau Data Visualization

This repository contains an interactive dashboard created using Tableau to analyze and visualize Netflix’s content library. The goal of this project was to uncover insights from Netflix’s catalog, including trends in genres, content distribution by country, release patterns, and ratings, while also building hands-on skills in data visualization and storytelling through Tableau.

## 📝 Project Overview

The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of Netflix’s global content library. It features a world map that visualizes the distribution of titles by country, highlighting which regions contribute most to Netflix’s catalog. A bar chart shows the top 10 genres, revealing user preferences and platform focus. The time-series chart traces the evolution of Netflix's content over the decades, with a noticeable surge post-2010. 

In addition to macro-level trends, the dashboard includes detailed insights into individual titles, such as duration, release year, genre, and the date the content was added to the platform. A rating distribution chart further explores how Netflix categorizes content based on viewer age groups, with TV-MA and TV-14 being the most common. Filters for title and type (TV Show or Movie) allow users to interact with and explore the data easily.
